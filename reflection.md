Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


In the House class, I chose to overload the constructor to allow the optional argument of food served in the dining hall. For example, I added Lamont house to my map, which has an allergen free dining hall, and specified the food type when I added the house. I also chose to overload the hasDiningHall method, so when a user input of true is given, the house will print out the kind of food its dining hall has. 

In the Library class, I overloaded the addTitle method to add a title with an optional true/false if the title is present to be checked out. I also overloaded the checkOut method to check out a list of books at once (because sometimes you want more than one at a time!)

In the Cafe class, I could only think of one overload to implement, as there were not a lot of methods to work with. I chose to overload the constructor, adding an optional "budget" argument, which is meant to represent the money the Cafe has to buy items, and sets how many of each item the Cafe starts with. 

This assigmnent was also pretty straightforward, but I struggled with deciding which methods to overload, as there were not a ton of options. I wanted to add an random option that the elevator in a house/library breaks down (because happens frequently here) but I ran out of time and could not find a way to fit it into an overloading method.
